Inherited from data/fonts_chk.md

# data/fonts_test checklist (phase: [test])

- [ ] Exposes curated families and generated pairings (fontPairings)
- [ ] Provides headingFamilyNames/bodyFamilyNames helpers
- [ ] assetsFor returns css stack, import URL, and license for a given family/role
- [ ] suggestPairings ranks by trait overlap and simple industry heuristics
- [ ] No network side effects; purely data/utility

---
Reconstructed notes (exp.md unavailable):
- Curates popular Google Fonts for headings and body; builds pairings combinatorially.
- Imports via CSS2 @import with specific weights (700 for heading, 400 for body).
- suggestPairings boosts matches on tone traits and simple industry cues (e.g., tech + monospace).
