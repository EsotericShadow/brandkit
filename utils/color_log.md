# utils/color_vrf — verification log

Inherited from utils/color_chk.md

# utils/color_test checklist (phase: [test])

- [ ] parseColor supports #RGB, #RRGGBB, rgb(r,g,b); rejects invalid inputs gracefully
- [ ] contrastRatio matches WCAG reference examples
- [ ] assessContrast flags AA/AAA and large-text thresholds correctly
- [ ] No floating point edge issues near thresholds
- [ ] Unit tests cover invalid/edge input cases

---
Reconstructed notes (exp.md unavailable):
- Exposes luminance-based contrast calculation consistent with WCAG 2.x.
- Used by GuideGenerator/ContrastChecks_test to badge AA/AAA thresholds.
- Accepts hex and rgb() inputs; returns null on invalid parses.

Verification updates
- 2025-08-27T16:33Z: Added tests for parseColor, contrastRatio, and assessContrast. Hardened parseColor to return null for invalid hex/rgb.
- 2025-08-27T16:33Z: Rewired components to import utils/color_vrf.
- 2025-08-27T16:33Z: All tests green post-promotion.
- 2025-08-27T17:08Z: Finalized promotion — inlined implementation into utils/color_vrf.ts and removed utils/color_test.ts; full typecheck and 45/45 tests passing.
