  "audience": "Our audience consists of product managers and engineering leads within SaaS companies who are struggling with slow feature delivery and excessive internal noise. They need practical ways to accelerate their development cycles and prioritize effectively, often triggered by project delays or a growing backlog. A common hesitation is the perceived complexity of adopting new tools or skepticism about AI's practical application in their daily work.",
  "pitchNotes": "When pitching Placeholder Labs, emphasize the direct challenge product teams face: too much internal distraction and not enough speed in getting features out. Position us as the straightforward path to quicker delivery. Our approach uses smart, practical AI to refine workflows, allowing teams to focus on what matters and build more effectively. We're for builders who want clear results, not just new methods. The core message is about cutting through the clutter to ship features with greater speed and precision."
