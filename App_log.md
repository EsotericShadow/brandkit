# App_vrf — verification log

Inherited from App_chk.md

# App_test checklist (phase: [test])

- [ ] App mounts and routes views correctly (GuideGenerator, VoiceRewriter, FontLibrary, ColorChecker)
- [ ] LocalStorage hydration/restoration works and tolerates corrupted data
- [ ] Dark mode styles applied across views
- [ ] Sidebar navigation updates AppView and preserves state
- [ ] No unhandled errors on initial load or when switching views
- [ ] Ready to promote to [vrf] after integration tests pass

Test log
- 2025-08-27T05:31:10Z: Ran typecheck (tsc --noEmit) — FAILED (import.meta.env typing); fixed by adding "vite/client" to tsconfig types; re-ran → SUCCESS (0 errors)
- 2025-08-27T05:31:10Z: Ran build (npm run build) — SUCCESS (0 warnings/errors)

Reconstructed notes (exp.md unavailable):
- Summary: App_test wires the shell (Sidebar_test + main view area) and routes between GuideGenerator/index_test, VoiceRewriter_test, FontLibrary_test, and ColorChecker_test using AppView.
- State: Persists and hydrates BrandGuide via localStorage key "brandGuide"; guards VoiceRewriter until guide exists.
- Theming: Tailwind CDN-driven classes for light/dark.
- Entry: index.tsx mounts App_test into #root via React 19 root API.

Verification updates
- 2025-08-27T16:52Z: Added integration tests for sidebar navigation, persistence, and editing; App re-export promoted to App_vrf.tsx and index.tsx rewired. Full suite green.
